# AI Tools

A small set of misc AI tools you can drop in to projects individually to implement
functionality you don't want to implement yourself, or don't want to use an inflexible
framework for.

This is a very early release with some basic functions.

## ContextManager: Add chat history/rag to your bot quickly.

ContextManager is a small tool to add chat history and external data to a chatbot.

See [chat_history.py](./chat_history.py) for an example, and
[context_manager](./context_manager/) for the README.

## PromptFormatter: Format messages for specific prompt templates.

PromptFormatter allows lower level prompt generation based on common model formats.

I don't recommend you use this. It is just a check-in of a pre-alpha generator.
